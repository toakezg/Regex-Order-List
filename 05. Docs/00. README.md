## Introduction to Regex Order List:
Regex Order List gives you the ability to use regex patterns to order a list by indentifying parts of a string. Inspired by the plugin 'Order List' which is no longer compatible with Obsidian. A basic use for this plugin, for example: It can identify the number at the end of a each list item and then via command, rearrange the list in numeric order. Perfect for a shopping lists eg. to work out what order you get the items in. Click on the following image to see full size example:

**you can even order it by isle**.

#### Remember:
1. Empty lines between list items are ignored.
2. Bullet, hyphen and numbered lists are able to be sorted.
3. Non-numbered list items are arranged alphabetically at the bottom of a list.
4. Non-numbered lists are arranged Alphabetically

By default the plugin will use the regex pattern `/(\d+\s*)+$/` or you can go into `settings > Regex Order List` and input your own custom regex pattern you wish to use and further yet save the custom regex pattern along with a name and description for future use and at any time you can restore the default pattern within the plugins settings tab. 
## Installation process: 
Simply go to `settings > community plugins` search for `Regex Order List`, select the plugin and press on the install button followed by enable plugin. 

or 

Go to https://github.com/toakezg/Regex-Order-List clone the repository and copy it into (desired\vualt\.obsidian\plugins) folder then enable the plugin.

## Usage Instructions:
To use the plugins features simply create a note or within an existing note highlight the list you want to sort, press `ctrl+p` to open the command palette, type `Order List by Regex` to find the plugins command then select and use the command. The list will then be rearranged.

Tip: Within `settings > hotkeys` you can create your own hotkey for the plugins "Order List by Regex" cmd to streamline its usage. 

## Features cover:
We've covered most of the common types of sorting needs, including:

1. **Numerical Sorting**: Single and multiple numbers.
2. **Alphabetical Sorting**: Purely alphabetical strings.
3. **Alphanumeric Sorting**: Mixed letters and numbers.
4. **Date Sorting**: Both international and standard formats.
5. **Version Number Sorting**: Numbers separated by delimiters (like hyphens).

## Future:
Although you can already use your own custom regex to create some order, we plan to include in the plugin addition regex patterns to use for some more advanced work such as:

1. Custom Delimiter Sorting
2. IP Address Sorting
3. Hexadecimal Sorting
4. Custom Tag or Label Sorting
5. Log File Entries
6. Scientific Notation sorting

As we gain more knowledge about regex, how to use it and what additional logic is required for things to be handled correctly, we will update the plugin along the way.
